Changes from 0.1.41 to 0.1.42 release:
-fixed clockwork riflebot deploy recipe getting disabled when loading a game where it was previously enabled. caused by a script error which should be double-checking/forcing recipes enabled if you have the right techs researched.
-removed some more debugging logs
-made squad wander radius based on the squad default radius config param
-more balance changes to droids, reduced physical and explosive resistance %
-fixed squad joining behaviours, was some residual bugs in that. 
-added storage entity called 'army loot chest'. has unique graphic and icon
-added squad artifact gathering - artifacts appear in the 'army loot chest'
-undersized squads that are "finished" (after an attack, lost some dudes) are sent back to nearest droid assembler to wait for reinforcements
-added unique graphic for droid assembler
-added config parameters to allow users to scale the default droid health and damage values. 
-added config parameter to determine when a squad that was hunting has fallen below a certain size and should retreat for reinforcements
-added config parameter to turn on/off the "squad x is no more..." death messages.
-put the range for "find nearest enemy" back to 5k tiles. there is a known issue where if no target is found, the entire squad disbands. it's not obvious why, but i can make a work-around later.
