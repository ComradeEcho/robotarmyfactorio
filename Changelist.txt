changes from 0.4.3 to 0.5.0:
- changed droid spawner to just a script-controlled chest. spawning now happens centrally around it. doesn't need recipe setting. just insert spawnable droid.
- added engineer droid
- added construction warehouse for engineer droid to build from items within them
- fixed issue where biter factions mod would cause crash with new forces (robot army try to run those forces' squad tick logic table functions)
