Changes from 0.3.4 to 0.3.5:
- removed all migration scripts prior to 0.3.4, because they shouldn't be needed anymore. with 0.16 and a large gap in robot army updates
 it's reasonable to assume everyone's games are in new-ish states, and don't need any of the old code migrations. 

- changed selection tool and pick up tool to be unlocked by the Military tech, with these added to the tech unlock effects

- new 0.3.5 migration script made for general purpose tech unlock fixing and doesn't include the rally point anymore.
