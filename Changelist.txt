Changes from 0.3.2 to 0.3.3:
- made hybrid targeting system default
- minor bug fix from dauphin for hybrid targeting
- bug fix for issue #102
- bug fix for when assemblers spawn too fast while squad moves away and stragglers wander instead of joining squad, casuing splintering and multiple failures
- fixed select/deselect visual bug with the green stickers
- added config param (default off) to re-enable the Artifact collection for those playing with Bobs/Natural Evolution which still have artifacts to collect!
