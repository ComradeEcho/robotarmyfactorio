Changes from 0.1.4 to 0.1.41 release:
-compatibility changes for Factorio 0.13 release
-increased squad chunk update range so they don't leave ghosts behind them as they move
-optimised script update rate, tested with 844 droids active with 60/60 fps. compared to 300 droids and 50fps and below. Was a linear increase but was not noticeable until you hit the 12ms update time
-removed some debug stuff.
