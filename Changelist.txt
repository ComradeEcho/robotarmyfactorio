changes from 0.4.3 to 0.5.0:
- changed droid spawner to just a script-controlled chest. spawning now happens centrally around it. doesn't need recipe setting. just insert spawnable droid.
- added engineer droid
- added construction warehouse for engineer droid to build from items within them
- fixed issue where biter factions mod would cause crash with new forces (robot army try to run those forces' squad tick logic table functions)
- increase rifle bot HP from 40 to 50. 
- decreased self-healing per tick by factor of 10. get engineer droids if you want field repairs! Terminator decreased by only factor of 4, still heals fast.
- added "allow_destroy_when_commands_fail" setting to all droids and flying units.
