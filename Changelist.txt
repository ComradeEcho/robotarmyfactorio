Changes from 0.1.43 to 0.1.44 release:
- fixed on_load being used incorrectly.
- fixed squads disbanding after successful mission or if they fail a move order and their unitgroup becomes invalid. they will keep re-forming the squad.
- changed all global tables to be referenced by force name so it's totally player-independant now. 
- added parameters for config to change grab artifacts radius
- made rocket droid splash area basically none, and made damage very high to help deal with big biters.
- fixed it so you don't lose the loot chest if you try to place it wrong
