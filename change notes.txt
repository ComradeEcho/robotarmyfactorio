-remove on_load() or replace with re-registering conditional event handlers

-make migration scripts including ones that were missing. migration scripts just force reset recipes and tech

-on_init() occurs when the map starts or when the mod is added to a an existing map. use this to set up all major global tables

-on_configuration_changed() event should handle mod version changes and should handle verifying all our global tables exist.
